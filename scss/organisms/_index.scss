// Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface. A header organism might consist of dissimilar elements such as a logo image, primary navigation list, and search form.

// Organisms demonstrate those smaller, simpler components in action and serve as distinct patterns that can be used again and again.
